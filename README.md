# MusiCAL

MusiCAL is an event recommendation app which allows users to see upcoming events being played by their favourite artists. When creating an account, they can connect their Spotify account which MusiCAL will take information about their favourite artists from. Then, by searching for events being played by those artists on Ticketmaster, the in-app calendar will populate automatically with recommendations. Information about the events including location, date, timings, price and purchase links are provided.

As well as this, MusiCAL includes a feature which recommends festivals with line-ups that include their favourite artists and genres. Finally introducing FestiCAL, the feature that provides users with their dream festival line-up poster. Using popular poster templates, users can choose their favourite design which will be populated with their favourite artists. Check out the app for yourself to see what artists come up!

MusiCAL is a collaborative final project, completed during our time at Northcoders.
